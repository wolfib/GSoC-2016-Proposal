            <h1>Experiments in using a force field to visualise short DNA sequence graphs</h1>
            <hr/>
            <p>In the following examples <a href="http://www.d3js.org">D3.js'</a> force layout was used to visualise short DNA sequences.</p>
            <p>A first naive implementation results in all nodes clustering around the image's center of gravity:</p>
            <div id="chart0"></div>
            <hr/>
            To mitigate this problem a force which pulls individual nodes towards the left/right was added:
            <div id="chart1"></div>
            <hr/>
            This force field is also suitable to display variations concerning single nucleotides (insertions, deletions, substitutions):
            <div id="chart2"></div>
            <hr/>
            Similar variations for multiple nucleotides can also be visualized:
            <div id="chart3"></div>
            <hr/>
            Sequence inversions result in a confusing visualisation though. I have changed the edges into arrows to improve the graph’s legibility. The visualisation shows two sequences. Grey arrows symbolise the parts where both sequences are the same. The diverging part is symbolised by red and blue arrows. The subsequence “CTAGCT” is traversed from left to right by the red path and from right to left by the blue path. The way this sequence inversion is displayed by the force field is not elegant and still needs to be improved.

            <hr/>
            Translocations result in a picture that looks like this:
            <div id="chart5"></div>
            <hr/>
            <p>These graphics only represent my first experiments in applying force fields to visualise DNA seqences. It is already obvious that some further modifications would be necessary to achieve better results (better alignment of the nodes, uniform link lenghts,...). A lot of further investigation work needs to be done first, before a decision can be made on whether and how to use (modified) force fields or a different approach for the creation of a JavaScript genomic sequence graph visualisation module.</p>
